## Branching Strategy
(disclaimer: not strictly enforced, do whatever you like)

- Main is for release builds
- Development is for in-dev builds (merge development onto main when ready/nearly ready for release)

Commit directly to main, if the change is minor (like readme or version number edits)

Commit directly to development, if the change is moderate and/or is implemented in a single commit (like code refactoring or bugfixing)

For major features, create a new branch, then PR that branch onto development once ready.

Temp Branches -> Development -> Main -> Release Tags
